# VersionControlProject
Team exercise for the course 4A00EZ62-3001 Backend SWDevel held in TAMK.

# How to get started
1. Fork this project from salter19's GitHub.
2. When project appears in your own repo, get it's url.
   That is url of your repo, not mine.
3. Open CLI. Following rows are commands to insert.

   4. git clone [your_url] <dir_name.git>
   5. cd dir
   6. npm install
   7. git remote add MASTER [my_url]
   8. git status     ---> IF everythings 'clean', proceed
   9. git checkout devel
   10. git fetch MASTER

Now you have the initial setup done.

Remember always to create your own branches from devel (never master).
